# House_Price_Prediction_Model
This repository contains code and resources for a linear regression-based housing price prediction model. The model is designed to estimate housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.

ALGORITHM
Certainly! The algorithm for the housing price prediction model using linear regression can be outlined as follows:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. **Load and Explore Data:**
   - Read the housing dataset ('USA_Housing.csv') using pandas.
   - Explore the structure of the dataset using `head()` and `info()` functions.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them if necessary.
   - Separate the feature variables (`X`) and target variable (`y`) from the dataset.
   - Standardize the feature variables using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

4. **Split Data:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

5. **Model Initialization:**
   - Initialize a linear regression model using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.

6. **Model Training:**
   - Train the linear regression model using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

7. **Model Prediction:**
   - Make predictions on the test data (`X_test`) using the trained linear regression model.

8. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model performance using the R-squared score (`r2_score`) between predicted and actual prices.

9. **Visualization:**
   - Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted housing prices.
   - Generate a histogram to analyze the distribution of residuals.

10. **Coefficient Analysis:**
    - Calculate and display the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted prices.

This algorithm provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the housing price prediction model using linear regression in Python.
